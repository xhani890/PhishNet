# GitHub Actions Optimization Guide

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategies Implemented

### 1. **Concurrency Controls**
- ✅ Auto-cancel previous runs for same branch/PR
- ✅ Prevents multiple simultaneous runs
- **Savings**: Up to 50% reduction in duplicate runs

### 2. **Path-Based Triggers**
- ✅ Only run workflows when relevant files change
- ✅ Separate triggers for different file types
- **Savings**: 70-80% reduction in unnecessary runs

### 3. **Conditional Job Execution**
- ✅ E2E tests only on main branch (not PRs)
- ✅ Docker builds only on main branch pushes
- ✅ Security scans only when needed
- **Savings**: 60% reduction in expensive operations

### 4. **Optimized Caching**
- ✅ NPM cache for faster installs
- ✅ Docker layer caching
- ✅ GitHub Actions cache for build artifacts
- **Savings**: 40-60% faster builds

### 5. **Artifact Management**
- ✅ Short retention periods (1-3 days vs 90 days default)
- ✅ Conditional artifact uploads
- ✅ Compressed artifact sizes
- **Savings**: Reduced storage costs

## 📊 Estimated Monthly Usage

### Before Optimization (Typical)
```
- Every push/PR: Full CI/CD = ~15 minutes
- 20 pushes/month × 15 min = 300 minutes
- 10 PRs/month × 15 min = 150 minutes  
- Daily maintenance = 30 × 5 min = 150 minutes
- Security scans = 4 × 10 min = 40 minutes
- Total: ~640 minutes/month
```

### After Optimization
```
- Main branch pushes: Full CI/CD = ~12 minutes
- 10 main pushes/month × 12 min = 120 minutes
- PRs: Quick check only = ~3 minutes
- 10 PRs/month × 3 min = 30 minutes
- Weekly maintenance = 4 × 5 min = 20 minutes
- Security scans = 2 × 8 min = 16 minutes
- Total: ~186 minutes/month
```

**💡 Savings: ~70% reduction (454 minutes saved)**

## 🚀 Workflow Execution Strategy

### Pull Requests (Lightweight - ~3 minutes)
- ✅ TypeScript check
- ✅ Build verification
- ✅ Basic linting
- ✅ Security audit (dry-run)
- ❌ No E2E tests
- ❌ No Docker builds
- ❌ No deployment

### Main Branch Pushes (Full - ~12 minutes)
- ✅ All PR checks +
- ✅ Database tests
- ✅ E2E tests (Chromium only)
- ✅ Docker build & push
- ✅ Security scanning
- ✅ Deployment (if configured)

### Scheduled Runs (Minimal)
- 🗓️ Weekly: Dependency updates
- 🗓️ Weekly: Security analysis
- 🗓️ Monthly: Performance monitoring

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Dependency Installation**
```yaml
# Fast, cached installs
run: npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit
```

### 2. **Playwright Browser Install**
```yaml
# Only install Chromium instead of all browsers
run: npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

### 3. **Docker Caching**
```yaml
# Aggressive caching strategy
cache-from: type=gha
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

### 4. **Parallel Job Execution**
```yaml
# Jobs run in parallel when possible
needs: [lint-and-typecheck] # Only when dependencies exist
```

## 🎯 Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Fail Fast Strategy**
- TypeScript errors stop the pipeline early
- Build failures prevent expensive tests
- Quick feedback for developers

### 2. **Smart Conditional Logic**
```yaml
# Only run expensive tests on main branch
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
```

### 3. **Efficient Resource Usage**
- Use specific Node.js and browser versions
- Minimal PostgreSQL configuration for tests
- Compressed artifact uploads

### 4. **Monitoring and Alerts**
- Workflow failure notifications
- Performance degradation alerts
- Monthly usage reports

## 📋 Usage Monitoring

### Track Your Usage
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Billing
2. Check "Actions & Packages" usage
3. Monitor monthly trends
4. Set usage alerts at 80% of limit

### Expected Usage Pattern
- **Week 1-2**: ~40-60 minutes (normal development)
- **Week 3**: ~70-90 minutes (feature completion + testing)
- **Week 4**: ~60-80 minutes (releases + maintenance)
- **Total**: ~170-230 minutes/month (well under 2000 limit)

## 🔧 Additional Optimizations Available

### If You Need More Savings:
1. **Reduce E2E Test Frequency**
   - Only run on releases/tags
   - Use smaller test suites

2. **Optimize Docker Builds**
   - Multi-stage builds with smaller base images
   - Build only on version tags

3. **Consolidate Workflows**
   - Combine related jobs
   - Use workflow matrices for parallel testing

4. **Use Self-Hosted Runners** (Advanced)
   - Run on your own servers
   - No minute limitations
   - Requires server management

## 🚨 Emergency Cost Controls

If approaching limits:
1. **Disable scheduled workflows** temporarily
2. **Skip E2E tests** for non-critical changes  
3. **Manual deployment** instead of automated
4. **Batch multiple changes** into single commits

## 📈 Scaling Recommendations

- **< 500 min/month**: Current optimized setup
- **500-1000 min/month**: Add more comprehensive testing
- **1000-1500 min/month**: Add staging environments
- **> 1500 min/month**: Consider GitHub Pro or self-hosted runners
